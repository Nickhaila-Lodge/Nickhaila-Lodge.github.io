    <h1>Information on Basal Metabolic Rate</h1>

    <h4>
        The quantity of calories your body requires to sustain essential physiological
        processes, such as breathing, circulation, cell creation, and nutrient digestion,
        when at rest is known as your Basal Metabolic Rate, or BMR.
        It is basically the energy needed to sustain life in
        your body in the absence of physical exertion or digestion.

            <CardTitle>Factors Influencing BMR</CardTitle>
            <br />
            <p>
                <ul><strong>Age:</strong> BMR tends to decrease with age due to loss of muscle mass and hormonal changes.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Sex:</strong> Males generally have a higher BMR than females, largely due to higher muscle mass.</ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Body Composition:</strong>
                    More muscle mass increases BMR, as muscle tissue burns more calories at rest compared to fat tissue.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Genetics:</strong> Some people naturally have a higher or lower BMR due to genetic factors.</ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Hormonal Factors:</strong> Thyroid hormones play a significant role in regulating metabolism.
                    Conditions like hypothyroidism can lower BMR, while hyperthyroidism can raise it.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Environmental Temperature:</strong>
                    Extreme temperatures can slightly increase BMR as the body works to maintain its core temperature.
                </ul>

            <br />
            <p>
                <ul><strong>Building Muscle:</strong> Engaging in resistance training can increase muscle mass, which may elevate BMR.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Healthy Eating:</strong> Adequate nutrition supports metabolism, while severe calorie restriction can decrease BMR.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> Regular aerobic and strength training can help maintain a higher metabolic rate.</ul>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Weight Management:</strong> Understanding your BMR can help you in weight loss or gain by calculating
                    how many calories you need to consume relative to your activity level.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Nutritional Planning:</strong> Knowing your BMR helps in designing an appropriate diet,
                    ensuring you get enough nutrients to support your metabolic needs.
